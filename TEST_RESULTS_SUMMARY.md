# Subject Management Feature - Test Results & Security Fix

## Test Suite Overview

Created comprehensive test script: `test_subject_management.py`

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✅ Authorized Subject Edit
2. ✅ Unauthorized Edit Prevention (Security)
3. ✅ History Tracking
4. ✅ User ID in History
5. ✅ Partial Updates

## Test Results: 5/5 PASSED ✓

### Test 1: Authorized Subject Edit ✅
**Purpose**: Verify that authorized users can edit their own subject.

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as UKNF admin (`admin_uknf@example.com`)
2. Get initial subject state
3. Update phone, email, and street fields
4. Verify all fields updated correctly

**Result**: PASSED
- Subject updated successfully
- All field values match the update request
- DATE_ACTRUALIZATION automatically updated

---

### Test 2: Unauthorized Edit Prevention (Security) ✅
**Purpose**: Verify that unauthorized users CANNOT edit other subjects.

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as Bank Pekao admin (`admin_pekao@example.com`)
2. Attempt to edit UKNF subject (subject_id=1)
3. Verify request is denied with 403 Forbidden

**Result**: PASSED
- Update correctly denied with HTTP 403
- Error message: "Access denied: you must be an administrator of this subject to edit it"
- **Security is working correctly!**

**Critical Bug Fixed**:
- Initial implementation only checked HTTP status code
- Auth-service returns 200 with `{"authorized": false}`
- Fixed to check BOTH status code AND response body
- Now properly enforces subject-level permissions

---

### Test 3: History Tracking ✅
**Purpose**: Verify that all changes are captured in the audit history.

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as UKNF admin
2. Get initial history count
3. Make two separate updates (with different timestamps)
4. Retrieve updated history
5. Verify new records were added

**Result**: PASSED
- Initial history: 8 records
- After 2 updates: 10 records
- 2 new history records captured
- Each record contains:
  - Operation type (UPDATE)
  - Modified timestamp
  - User ID who made the change
  - Snapshot of old values

---

### Test 4: User ID in History ✅
**Purpose**: Verify that history records identify who made each change.

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as UKNF admin
2. Retrieve history
3. Check that records contain MODIFIED_BY field
4. Verify user ID is correctly recorded

**Result**: PASSED
- 9 out of 10 history records have user ID
- User ID correctly identifies the admin who made changes
- Example: User ID 2 = UKNF admin

---

### Test 5: Partial Updates ✅
**Purpose**: Verify that updating one field doesn't affect other fields.

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as UKNF admin
2. Get current subject state (record email and street)
3. Update ONLY the phone number
4. Verify phone changed but email and street unchanged

**Result**: PASSED
- Phone number successfully updated
- Email remained unchanged
- Street remained unchanged
- Only specified fields are modified

## Security Fix Details

### The Bug
**Issue**: Any authenticated user could edit any subject, bypassing authorization checks.

**Root Cause**: 
```python
# BEFORE (INSECURE):
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Get user_id and allow edit
    # Problem: auth-service returns 200 even when unauthorized!
```

The auth-service returns:
- HTTP 200 with `{"authorized": true}` when access granted
- HTTP 200 with `{"authorized": false}` when access denied

The code only checked status code (200), not the body.

### The Fix
```python
# AFTER (SECURE):
if response.status_code == 200:
    auth_result = response.json()
    if auth_result.get("authorized") is True:
        # Only now get user_id and allow edit
    # Otherwise raise 403
```

Now checks BOTH:
1. HTTP status code (200)
2. Response body's "authorized" field (must be True)

**File Modified**: `administration-service/main.py`, line 462-471

## Configuration Changes Made

### 1. Nginx Proxy Configuration
**File**: `frontend/nginx.conf`

**Added**:
```nginx
# Administration service proxy
location /admin/ {
    proxy_pass http://administration-service:8000/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```

**Purpose**: Route `/admin/*` requests to administration-service.

## Maintenance

### Running Tests Regularly
Add to CI/CD pipeline:
```bash
# Run tests as part of deployment
python3 test_subject_management.py || exit 1
```

### Adding New Tests
The test script is easy to extend:
```python
def test_new_feature():
    """Test new functionality"""
    # Test implementation
    return True  # or False

# Add to tests list
tests = [
    # ... existing tests ...
    ("New Feature", test_new_feature),
]
```
