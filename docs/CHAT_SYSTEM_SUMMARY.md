### Cascade Behavior

**Delete a CONVERSATION:**
- ‚úÖ Deletes all participants
- ‚úÖ Deletes all messages
  - ‚úÖ Deletes all attachments
  - ‚úÖ Deletes all read receipts
  - ‚úÖ Deletes all reactions
- ‚úÖ Deletes all tags
- ‚úÖ Deletes assignment history

**Delete a USER:**
- ‚ùå Cannot delete if they created conversations (RESTRICT)
- ‚ùå Cannot delete if they sent messages (RESTRICT)
- ‚úÖ Removes them as assignee (SET NULL)
- ‚úÖ Deletes their participations (CASCADE)
- ‚úÖ Deletes their read receipts (CASCADE)
- ‚úÖ Deletes their reactions (CASCADE)

**Delete a SUBJECT:**
- ‚úÖ Deletes all related conversations (CASCADE)
  - ‚úÖ Including all nested data

- Common tags: `vip`, `urgent`, `sla-breach-risk`, `technical-issue`

### 7. Assignment Management
- Assign conversations to staff
- Track complete assignment history
- Record who assigned, when, and why

### 8. Metadata Fields
- JSONB fields on CONVERSATIONS and MESSAGES

## üìù Usage Examples

### Create Conversation
```sql
-- 1. Create conversation
INSERT INTO "CONVERSATIONS" ("SUBJECT_ID", "TYPE", "CREATED_BY_USER_ID", "TITLE")
VALUES (1, 'support', 5, 'Cannot submit report')
RETURNING "ID";

-- 2. Add participants
INSERT INTO "CONVERSATION_PARTICIPANTS" ("CONVERSATION_ID", "USER_ID", "ROLE")
VALUES (1, 5, 'requester'), (1, 3, 'agent');
```

### Send Message
```sql
-- Public message
INSERT INTO "MESSAGES" ("CONVERSATION_ID", "SENDER_USER_ID", "BODY", "VISIBILITY")
VALUES (1, 5, 'I need help with the form.', 'public');

UPDATE "CONVERSATIONS" SET "LAST_MESSAGE_AT" = NOW() WHERE "ID" = 1;

-- Internal note
INSERT INTO "MESSAGES" ("CONVERSATION_ID", "SENDER_USER_ID", "BODY", "VISIBILITY")
VALUES (1, 3, 'User might need password reset', 'internal');
```

### Assign Conversation
```sql
UPDATE "CONVERSATIONS" SET "ASSIGNED_TO_USER_ID" = 3 WHERE "ID" = 1;

INSERT INTO "ASSIGNMENT_HISTORY" ("CONVERSATION_ID", "ASSIGNED_TO_USER_ID", "ASSIGNED_BY_USER_ID", "NOTE")
VALUES (1, 3, 2, 'Assigned to senior agent');
```

### Mark as Read
```sql
INSERT INTO "READ_RECEIPTS" ("MESSAGE_ID", "USER_ID")
VALUES (10, 3)
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

### Add Reaction
```sql
INSERT INTO "MESSAGE_REACTIONS" ("MESSAGE_ID", "USER_ID", "EMOJI")
VALUES (10, 3, 'üëç')
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

### Tag Conversation
```sql
INSERT INTO "CONVERSATION_TAGS" ("CONVERSATION_ID", "TAG", "ADDED_BY_USER_ID")
VALUES (1, 'vip', 2), (1, 'urgent', 2);
```

## üé® Common Queries

### My Assigned Conversations
```sql
SELECT c.*, s."NAME_STRUCTURE", COUNT(m."ID") as msg_count
FROM "CONVERSATIONS" c
JOIN "SUBJECTS" s ON c."SUBJECT_ID" = s."ID"
LEFT JOIN "MESSAGES" m ON c."ID" = m."CONVERSATION_ID"
WHERE c."ASSIGNED_TO_USER_ID" = :user_id
  AND c."STATUS" IN ('open', 'pending')
GROUP BY c."ID", s."NAME_STRUCTURE"
ORDER BY c."LAST_MESSAGE_AT" DESC;
```

### Unread Messages
```sql
SELECT m.*
FROM "MESSAGES" m
LEFT JOIN "READ_RECEIPTS" rr ON m."ID" = rr."MESSAGE_ID" AND rr."USER_ID" = :user_id
WHERE m."CONVERSATION_ID" = :conversation_id
  AND rr."ID" IS NULL
  AND m."DELETED_AT" IS NULL
ORDER BY m."CREATED_AT" ASC;
```

### Conversations by Tag
```sql
SELECT c.*
FROM "CONVERSATIONS" c
JOIN "CONVERSATION_TAGS" ct ON c."ID" = ct."CONVERSATION_ID"
WHERE ct."TAG" = 'urgent'
  AND c."STATUS" = 'open'
ORDER BY c."LAST_MESSAGE_AT" DESC;
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Visibility Rules
1. **Requester** sees only public messages
2. **Staff** (agent/observer/manager) see all messages
3. Internal messages NEVER exposed to clients
4. Always filter by visibility in queries

### Example Query with Visibility Check
```sql
SELECT m.*
FROM "MESSAGES" m
WHERE m."CONVERSATION_ID" = :conversation_id
  AND (
    m."VISIBILITY" = 'public' 
    OR :user_role IN ('agent', 'observer', 'manager')
  )
  AND m."DELETED_AT" IS NULL
ORDER BY m."CREATED_AT" ASC;
```
