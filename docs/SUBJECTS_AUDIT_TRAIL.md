# SUBJECTS Audit Trail System

## Overview

An automated, database-level audit trail system that tracks all modifications to the `SUBJECTS` table. Every `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operation is automatically logged with complete historical data.

---

## üéØ Features

- **Automatic Tracking**: No application code changes required
- **Complete History**: Captures full snapshot of data before changes
- **User Attribution**: Links changes to specific users
- **Operation Types**: Distinguishes between UPDATE and DELETE operations
- **High Performance**: Optimized indexes for fast querying
- **GDPR Ready**: Full audit trail for compliance requirements
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run migration multiple times

## üìä Database Schema

### SUBJECTS_HISTORY Table

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **HISTORY_ID** | BIGINT (PK) | Unique identifier for each history record |
| **OPERATION_TYPE** | VARCHAR(10) | 'UPDATE' or 'DELETE' |
| **MODIFIED_AT** | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the change occurred |
| **MODIFIED_BY** | BIGINT (FK ‚Üí USERS.ID) | Who made the change (nullable) |
| **ID** | BIGINT | Subject ID (from original table) |
| ... | ... | All other SUBJECTS columns |

### Indexes

```sql
IDX_SUBJECTS_HISTORY_SUBJECT_ID    -- Fast lookups by subject
IDX_SUBJECTS_HISTORY_MODIFIED_AT   -- Chronological queries
IDX_SUBJECTS_HISTORY_OPERATION_TYPE -- Filter by operation
IDX_SUBJECTS_HISTORY_MODIFIED_BY   -- Query by user
```

---

## üöÄ Installation

### Apply Migration

```bash
# Using psql
psql -U myuser -d mydatabase -f migrations/012_add_subjects_history_trigger.sql

# Using Docker Compose (automatic on container restart)
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Verify Installation

```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'SUBJECTS_HISTORY';

-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'subjects_history_trigger';

-- Check if function exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name = 'log_subjects_changes';
```

---

## üíª Application Integration

### Setting User Context

Before any UPDATE or DELETE on SUBJECTS, set the user ID:

**Python/FastAPI Example:**

```python
from sqlalchemy import text

def update_subject_with_audit(db: Session, subject_id: int, user_id: int, updates: dict):
    """Update subject with automatic audit trail"""
    try:
        # Set user context for audit trail
        db.execute(text("SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = :user_id"), {"user_id": user_id})
        
        # Perform the update
        stmt = update(subjects).where(subjects.c.ID == subject_id).values(**updates)
        db.execute(stmt)
        db.commit()
        
    except Exception as e:
        db.rollback()
        raise
```

**Direct SQL Example:**

```sql
BEGIN;
    -- Set user context
    SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = 5;
    
    -- Make your changes
    UPDATE "SUBJECTS" 
    SET "NAME_STRUCTURE" = 'New Company Name',
        "STATUS_S" = 'active'
    WHERE "ID" = 1;
COMMIT;
```

### Without User Context

If you don't set `app.current_user_id`, the trigger still works but `MODIFIED_BY` will be `NULL`:

```sql
-- This works but MODIFIED_BY will be NULL
UPDATE "SUBJECTS" SET "STATUS_S" = 'inactive' WHERE "ID" = 1;
```

---

## üìà Query Examples

### 1. View All Changes for a Subject

```sql
SELECT 
    "HISTORY_ID",
    "OPERATION_TYPE",
    "MODIFIED_AT",
    "MODIFIED_BY",
    "NAME_STRUCTURE",
    "STATUS_S",
    "VALIDATED"
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
WHERE "ID" = 1
ORDER BY "MODIFIED_AT" DESC;
```

### 2. Get Changes by Specific User

```sql
SELECT 
    sh."MODIFIED_AT",
    sh."OPERATION_TYPE",
    sh."ID" as subject_id,
    sh."NAME_STRUCTURE",
    u."EMAIL" as modified_by
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" sh
JOIN "USERS" u ON sh."MODIFIED_BY" = u."ID"
WHERE u."ID" = 5
ORDER BY sh."MODIFIED_AT" DESC;
```

### 3. Compare Current vs Previous State

```sql
WITH current_state AS (
    SELECT * FROM "SUBJECTS" WHERE "ID" = 1
),
previous_state AS (
    SELECT * FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" 
    WHERE "ID" = 1 
    ORDER BY "MODIFIED_AT" DESC 
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
    'Field' as field_name,
    'Current' as state,
    c."NAME_STRUCTURE" as name,
    c."STATUS_S" as status,
    c."VALIDATED" as validated
FROM current_state c
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Field' as field_name,
    'Previous' as state,
    p."NAME_STRUCTURE",
    p."STATUS_S",
    p."VALIDATED"
FROM previous_state p;
```

### 4. Audit Report - Last 30 Days

```sql
SELECT 
    sh."MODIFIED_AT",
    sh."OPERATION_TYPE",
    sh."ID" as subject_id,
    sh."NAME_STRUCTURE",
    COALESCE(u."EMAIL", 'System') as modified_by,
    CASE 
        WHEN sh."OPERATION_TYPE" = 'DELETE' THEN 'Subject Deleted'
        WHEN sh."OPERATION_TYPE" = 'UPDATE' THEN 'Subject Modified'
    END as action_description
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" sh
LEFT JOIN "USERS" u ON sh."MODIFIED_BY" = u."ID"
WHERE sh."MODIFIED_AT" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY sh."MODIFIED_AT" DESC;
```

### 5. Find Who Deleted Subjects

```sql
SELECT 
    sh."MODIFIED_AT" as deleted_at,
    sh."ID" as subject_id,
    sh."NAME_STRUCTURE" as subject_name,
    sh."UKNF_ID",
    u."EMAIL" as deleted_by,
    u."USER_NAME" || ' ' || u."USER_LASTNAME" as user_name
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" sh
LEFT JOIN "USERS" u ON sh."MODIFIED_BY" = u."ID"
WHERE sh."OPERATION_TYPE" = 'DELETE'
ORDER BY sh."MODIFIED_AT" DESC;
```

### 6. Subjects Modified Multiple Times

```sql
SELECT 
    "ID" as subject_id,
    COUNT(*) as change_count,
    MIN("MODIFIED_AT") as first_change,
    MAX("MODIFIED_AT") as last_change
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
GROUP BY "ID"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY change_count DESC;
```

### 7. Changes Without User Attribution

```sql
-- Find changes where user is unknown (system changes or missing context)
SELECT 
    "MODIFIED_AT",
    "OPERATION_TYPE",
    "ID" as subject_id,
    "NAME_STRUCTURE"
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
WHERE "MODIFIED_BY" IS NULL
ORDER BY "MODIFIED_AT" DESC;
```

---

## üîç Advanced Use Cases

### Point-in-Time Recovery

Restore a subject to a previous state:

```sql
-- 1. Find the state you want to restore
SELECT * FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" 
WHERE "ID" = 1 
  AND "MODIFIED_AT" < '2025-10-01 10:00:00'
ORDER BY "MODIFIED_AT" DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Restore (after verifying the data)
UPDATE "SUBJECTS"
SET 
    "NAME_STRUCTURE" = (SELECT "NAME_STRUCTURE" FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" 
                        WHERE "ID" = 1 ORDER BY "MODIFIED_AT" DESC LIMIT 1),
    "STATUS_S" = (SELECT "STATUS_S" FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" 
                  WHERE "ID" = 1 ORDER BY "MODIFIED_AT" DESC LIMIT 1)
    -- ... other fields
WHERE "ID" = 1;
```

### Audit Trail Export

Export complete audit trail for compliance:

```sql
COPY (
    SELECT 
        sh."MODIFIED_AT",
        sh."OPERATION_TYPE",
        sh."ID",
        sh."NAME_STRUCTURE",
        sh."UKNF_ID",
        u."EMAIL" as modified_by_email
    FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" sh
    LEFT JOIN "USERS" u ON sh."MODIFIED_BY" = u."ID"
    WHERE sh."MODIFIED_AT" BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'
    ORDER BY sh."MODIFIED_AT"
) TO '/tmp/subjects_audit_2025.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

### Change Frequency Analysis

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', "MODIFIED_AT") as day,
    "OPERATION_TYPE",
    COUNT(*) as change_count
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
WHERE "MODIFIED_AT" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', "MODIFIED_AT"), "OPERATION_TYPE"
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

### Access Control

```sql
-- Grant read access to auditors
GRANT SELECT ON "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" TO auditor_role;

-- Prevent direct modifications
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" FROM public;
```

### GDPR Considerations

1. **Right to Access**: Users can query their modification history
2. **Right to Erasure**: History may need to be anonymized or deleted
3. **Data Retention**: Implement retention policies

```sql
-- Example: Anonymize user data after 7 years
UPDATE "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
SET "MODIFIED_BY" = NULL
WHERE "MODIFIED_AT" < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 years';
```

### Audit Alerts

Create a view for suspicious activity:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW suspicious_subject_changes AS
SELECT 
    sh."MODIFIED_AT",
    sh."OPERATION_TYPE",
    sh."ID",
    u."EMAIL",
    COUNT(*) OVER (
        PARTITION BY sh."MODIFIED_BY" 
        ORDER BY sh."MODIFIED_AT" 
        RANGE INTERVAL '1 hour' PRECEDING
    ) as changes_in_last_hour
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" sh
LEFT JOIN "USERS" u ON sh."MODIFIED_BY" = u."ID"
WHERE sh."MODIFIED_AT" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Find users making too many changes
SELECT * FROM suspicious_subject_changes 
WHERE changes_in_last_hour > 10;
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Table Size Monitoring

```sql
-- Check history table size
SELECT 
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('SUBJECTS_HISTORY')) as total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('SUBJECTS_HISTORY')) as table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size('SUBJECTS_HISTORY')) as indexes_size,
    COUNT(*) as row_count
FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY";
```

### Performance Statistics

```sql
-- Analyze trigger overhead
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_upd as updates,
    n_tup_del as deletes,
    last_autovacuum,
    last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE tablename = 'SUBJECTS';
```

### Data Retention

```sql
-- Archive old history records (older than 7 years)
-- Step 1: Export to archive table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "SUBJECTS_HISTORY_ARCHIVE" 
    (LIKE "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" INCLUDING ALL);

INSERT INTO "SUBJECTS_HISTORY_ARCHIVE"
SELECT * FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
WHERE "MODIFIED_AT" < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 years';

-- Step 2: Delete from main table
DELETE FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
WHERE "MODIFIED_AT" < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 years';

-- Step 3: Vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM ANALYZE "SUBJECTS_HISTORY";
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test the Trigger

```sql
-- Test 1: UPDATE operation
BEGIN;
    SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = 1;
    
    -- Create test subject
    INSERT INTO "SUBJECTS" ("NAME_STRUCTURE", "UKNF_ID", "STATUS_S")
    VALUES ('Test Subject', 'TEST001', 'active')
    RETURNING "ID";  -- Note the ID (e.g., 100)
    
    -- Update it
    UPDATE "SUBJECTS" 
    SET "NAME_STRUCTURE" = 'Modified Test Subject'
    WHERE "ID" = 100;
    
    -- Check history
    SELECT * FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" WHERE "ID" = 100;
    -- Should show 1 record with OPERATION_TYPE = 'UPDATE'
ROLLBACK;

-- Test 2: DELETE operation
BEGIN;
    SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = 1;
    
    -- Create and delete
    INSERT INTO "SUBJECTS" ("NAME_STRUCTURE", "UKNF_ID")
    VALUES ('To Delete', 'TEST002')
    RETURNING "ID";  -- Note the ID
    
    DELETE FROM "SUBJECTS" WHERE "ID" = 101;
    
    -- Check history
    SELECT * FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" WHERE "ID" = 101;
    -- Should show 1 record with OPERATION_TYPE = 'DELETE'
ROLLBACK;

-- Test 3: Without user context
BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO "SUBJECTS" ("NAME_STRUCTURE", "UKNF_ID")
    VALUES ('No User', 'TEST003')
    RETURNING "ID";
    
    UPDATE "SUBJECTS" SET "STATUS_S" = 'inactive' WHERE "ID" = 102;
    
    SELECT "MODIFIED_BY" FROM "SUBJECTS_HISTORY" WHERE "ID" = 102;
    -- Should be NULL
ROLLBACK;
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: History records not created

**Check if trigger is active:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'subjects_history_trigger';
```

**Check if function exists:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'log_subjects_changes';
```

### Issue: MODIFIED_BY always NULL

**Solution:** Make sure you're setting the session variable:
```sql
SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = <user_id>;
```

### Issue: Performance degradation

**Solutions:**
1. Analyze and vacuum regularly:
   ```sql
   VACUUM ANALYZE "SUBJECTS_HISTORY";
   ```

2. Partition large history tables:
   ```sql
   -- Create partitioned table for future (requires migration)
   CREATE TABLE "SUBJECTS_HISTORY_2026" 
   PARTITION OF "SUBJECTS_HISTORY"
   FOR VALUES FROM ('2026-01-01') TO ('2027-01-01');
   ```

3. Archive old records (see Data Retention section)

---

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Always Set User Context**: Include user ID in transactions
2. **Monitor Table Growth**: Set up alerts for rapid growth
3. **Regular Archival**: Move old records to archive tables
4. **Backup Strategy**: Include history table in backups
5. **Access Logging**: Log who queries the audit trail
6. **Retention Policy**: Define and document retention periods
7. **Performance Testing**: Test trigger impact under load

---

## üö® Important Notes

### What Gets Logged

‚úÖ **Logged:**
- Every UPDATE to SUBJECTS table
- Every DELETE from SUBJECTS table
- Full snapshot of data BEFORE the change
- Timestamp of modification
- User who made the change (if set)

‚ùå **Not Logged:**
- INSERT operations (new subjects)
- SELECT queries (read operations)
- Changes to other tables

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: ~5-10% overhead per UPDATE/DELETE
- **One INSERT** per modification
- **Indexes optimized** for fast queries
- **No impact** on SELECT performance

### Storage Requirements

Approximately equal to SUBJECTS table size multiplied by average number of changes per record. For example:
- 10,000 subjects
- Average 5 modifications each
- Result: ~50,000 history records
