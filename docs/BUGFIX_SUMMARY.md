# Bug Fix Summary - October 5, 2025

## üêõ Issue Report

**Problem:** Frontend login was failing for all users, including `admin@example.com`, `admin_uknf@example.com`, and `admin_pekao@example.com`.

**Symptoms:**
- Users couldn't log in through the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend was showing network errors or 502 Bad Gateway
- Browser console showed failed API calls to `/auth/authn`

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Nginx Proxy Misconfiguration

The frontend's nginx reverse proxy was incorrectly configured, causing it to fail when forwarding authentication requests to the auth-service.

**Technical Details:**

**Before (Broken):**
```nginx
location /auth {
    proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001;
}
```

**Problem:**
- When frontend calls `/auth/authn`
- Nginx forwards to: `http://auth-service:8001/auth/authn`
- But auth-service expects: `http://auth-service:8001/authn` ‚ùå

**After (Fixed):**
```nginx
location /auth/ {
    proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001/;
}
```

**Solution:**
- When frontend calls `/auth/authn`
- Nginx strips `/auth/` and forwards to: `http://auth-service:8001/authn` ‚úÖ
- Auth-service successfully processes the request

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Nginx Auth Proxy Configuration** ‚úÖ

**File:** `frontend/nginx.conf`

**Change:**
```diff
- location /auth {
-     proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001;
+ location /auth/ {
+     proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001/;
```

**Why:** Adding trailing slashes tells nginx to replace the matched prefix (`/auth/`) with the proxy destination's path (`/`), effectively stripping the prefix.

## üß™ Testing Results

### ‚úÖ All Admin Accounts Working

**1. Default Admin (`admin@example.com`)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/authn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "admin"}'

Response: {"session_id": "...", "expires_in": 86400}
Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**2. UKNF Admin (`admin_uknf@example.com`)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/authn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin_uknf@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

Response: {"session_id": "...", "expires_in": 86400}
Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**3. Bank Pekao Admin (`admin_pekao@example.com`)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/authn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin_pekao@example.com", "password": "password456"}'

Response: {"session_id": "...", "expires_in": 86400}
Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

- ‚ùå 502 Bad Gateway errors
- ‚ùå Connection refused errors in nginx logs
- ‚ùå All authentication flows blocked

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Frontend login working for all users
- ‚úÖ All three admin accounts verified
- ‚úÖ Session management working
- ‚úÖ Authentication flow restored

## üîß Technical Deep Dive

### Nginx Proxy Behavior

**Without Trailing Slash:**
```nginx
location /auth {
    proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001;
}
```
- Request: `GET /auth/authn`
- Proxied to: `http://auth-service:8001/auth/authn`
- Full URI is appended

**With Trailing Slash:**
```nginx
location /auth/ {
    proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001/;
}
```
- Request: `GET /auth/authn`
- Match: `/auth/` is stripped
- Remainder: `authn`
- Proxied to: `http://auth-service:8001/authn`
- Prefix is replaced

### Why This Matters

The auth-service FastAPI application defines routes at the root level:
```python
@app.post("/authn")  # Not /auth/authn
@app.post("/authz")  # Not /auth/authz
@app.post("/register")  # Not /auth/register
```

The `/auth` prefix exists only for the frontend's routing and nginx proxying.

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Findings

### Working Services ‚úÖ

1. **Auth Service** (Port 8001)
   - Direct access: ‚úÖ Working
   - Through frontend proxy: ‚úÖ Working (after fix)

2. **Communication Service** (Port 8002)
   - Direct access: ‚úÖ Working
   - Through frontend proxy: ‚úÖ Working (already correct)

3. **Administration Service** (Port 8000)
   - Direct access: ‚úÖ Working
   - Not proxied through frontend (not needed)

4. **Database** (PostgreSQL)
   - Status: ‚úÖ Up and running
   - All migrations applied: ‚úÖ Verified

5. **Redis** (Session Storage)
   - Status: ‚úÖ Up and running
   - Session storage: ‚úÖ Working

## üìù Deployment Steps

To apply this fix in any environment:

```bash
# 1. Update nginx.conf
vim frontend/nginx.conf
# Change: location /auth { to location /auth/ {
# Change: proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001; to proxy_pass http://auth-service:8001/;

# 2. Rebuild frontend
docker compose build frontend

# 3. Restart frontend
docker compose up -d frontend

# 4. Verify
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/authn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@example.com", "password": "admin"}'
```

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. **Nginx Proxy Trailing Slashes Matter**
- Always be explicit about trailing slashes in `location` and `proxy_pass`
- Test proxy configurations before deploying

### 2. **Test from User's Perspective**
- Backend APIs working directly doesn't mean frontend integration works
- Always test through the complete stack

### 3. **Check Logs at Every Layer**
- Frontend nginx logs revealed the 502 errors
- Auth service logs showed it was actually working fine
- Problem was in the middle (proxy layer)

### 4. **Docker Networking**
- Service names resolve correctly (e.g., `auth-service:8001`)
- Containers can communicate internally
- Proxy configuration is critical for external access

## ‚ú® Summary

**Issue:** Login broken due to nginx proxy misconfiguration  
**Root Cause:** Missing trailing slashes causing incorrect path forwarding  
**Fix:** Added trailing slashes to `location` and `proxy_pass` directives  
**Result:** All authentication flows now working perfectly  

**Time to Fix:** ~15 minutes  
**Lines Changed:** 2 lines in `frontend/nginx.conf`  
**Impact:** 100% of frontend login functionality restored
